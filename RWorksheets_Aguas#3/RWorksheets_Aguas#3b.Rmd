#2. Write a R program to create an empty data frame. Using the following codes:

df = data.frame(Ints=integer(),

Doubles=double(), Characters=character(),
Logicals=logical(),
Factors=factor(),
stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

print("Structure of the empty dataframe:")
print(str(df))


#a. Describe the results.
#This software will build a blank data frame using the column names and data types you specify when you run it. The structure of the empty data frame is then printed using the str() function. 

#3. Create a .csv file of this. Save it as HouseholdData.csv
