#1. The table below shows the data about shoe size and height. Create a data frame.

Shoesize <- data.frame (
Gender=c("F","F","F","F","M","F","F","F","M","F","M","F","M","M","M","M","F","F","M","F","F","M","M","F","M","M","M","M"),
ShoeSize=c(6.5,9.0,8.5,8.5,10.5,7.0,9.5,9.0,13.0,7.5,10.5,8.5,12.0,10.5,13.0,11.5,8.5,5.0,10.0,6.5,7.5,8.5,10.5,8.5,10.5,11.0,9.0,13.0),
Height=c(66.0,68.0,64.5,65.0,70.0,64.0,70.0,71.0,72.0,64.0,74.5,67.0,71.0,71.0,77.0,72.0,59.0,62.0,72.0,66.0,64.0,67.0,73.0,69.0,72.0,70.0,69.0,70.0)
)
Shoesize

#a. Describe the data.



#b. Create a subset by males and females with their corresponding shoe size and height.What its result? Show the R scripts.

malesubset <- Shoesize[Shoesize$Gender == "M", c("Gender", "ShoeSize", "Height")]
femalesubset <- Shoesize[Shoesize$Gender == "F", c("Gender", "ShoeSize", "Height")]
malesubset
femalesubset

#c. Find the mean of shoe size and height of the respondents. Write the R scripts and its result.

meanofShoeSize <- mean(Shoesize$ShoeSize)
meanofHeight <- mean(Shoesize$Height)
meanofShoeSize
meanofHeight

#d. Is there a relationship between shoe size and height? Why?
correlationCoefficient <- cor(Shoesize$ShoeSize, Shoesize$Height)
correlationCoefficient

#2. Construct character vector months to a factor with factor() and assign the result to factor_months_vector. Print out factor_months_vector and assert that R prints out the factor levels below the actual values.
months <- c("March","April","January","November","January",
            "September","October","September","November","August",
            "January","November","November","February","May","August",
            "July","December","August","August","September","November","February",
            "April")
factorMonthsVec <- factor(months)
factorMonthsVec

#3. Then check the summary() of the months_vector and factor_months_vector. | Inter-pret the results of both vectors. Are they both equally useful in this case?

summaryofMonths<- summary (months)
summaryofMonths
